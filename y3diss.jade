						h4 Preface
						p I regularly explored deserted factories around the Midlands in England where I grew up. Old Victorian potteries and grand mills, the industrial hinterlands of Derby and Sheffield, they all entertained my curious fascination with the crumbling reminders of our past. I moved to Berlin some months ago and immediately noticed many similarities between abandoned spaces here and those back home. There are physical similarities of course, but it is the social contexts that seem to surround disused spaces and how they are sometimes re-used, that intrigued me more. The preconditions for spaces falling into disuse are often localised to the city or country, whereas instances whereby people instigate re-use of these spaces, seem to be part of a much wider socio-spatial phenomenon.
						em My research is concerned with mechanisms of re-use; transitional praxis in spaces that are caught in the lurch between disuse, and something more permanent.
