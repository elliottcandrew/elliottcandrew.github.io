In England that might not mean too much, but in Germany it is the national holiday Tag der Arbeit (workers’ day).  The day has a rich history, especially in the capital. Traditionally protesters gather in large numbers, supporting a variety of causes and Kotbusser Tor, often the nucleus of demonstrations, invariably descends into violent confrontations with police.</p>

<p>I wasn’t aware of a great deal of animosity as I experienced my first Tag der Arbeit this year. According to friends who have lived here for years: “the festival has taken on much more of a festival vibe in the last decade or so”. What I did notice however, was a complete transformation of the city, the streets of Kreuzberg were off limits to cars with throngs of revellers filling the streets, filtering slowly in all directions. Music blared from open windows while the occupants hung lazily on the sills, chatting to friends out of sight inside. Görlitzer park, although never particularly quiet, was busier than I had ever seen it previously. Every inch of grass covered with groups of all colours and ages, their conversation mingling with the Reggae band performing on the far side of the shallow bomb-crater, (where the train station once stood) and the punching bass of a sound-system close by. Impromptu music performances coaxed passers-by into dancing with one another; food vendors sold from informal stalls, barbecues and even luminescent shots for €1 poured from unmarked plastic bottles—all fuelling the eclectic, vibrant enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At this moment in time, for the duration of this day, Görlitzer park was transformed into a raucous, loud, colourful, intoxicated, glorious commons. In the absence of a single authoritative figure, a civic stewardship governed the disorganised proceedings; every member jointly involved in creating a common experience. Describing a similar social order revealed in the tumult of activity outside her front door in New York City, Jane Jacobs writes—“this order is comprised of movement and change, and although it is life, not art, we may fancifully call it the art form of the city”.</p>

<p>Come the morning of May 2nd, Görlitzer had already returned to its usual host of visitors: lines of weed dealers, locals on their way to work, curious tourists buying cheap weed and so on. The commons really is utterly dependent on a complex interplay of overlapping – sometimes antagonistic, sometimes complimentary – social conditions. In Henri Lefebvre’s immortal words:</p>

<p>“(social) space is a (social) product”</p>

<p>The venue plays a part, but ultimately it is the users of space that produce its common, social, spatial, temporal wealth.</p>
